We are the team with the most random team name ever: Team Random. But that doesn't mean that we just do random stuff. On the contrary!

## Our philosophy

Our goal is to make learning a new language less random. Usually all students are all given the same semi-random vocabulary list, irrespective of what these students will use the language for. We want to change this. Because by learning words that you actually are interested in, you will learn much faster. That is why we ask our students what's on their mind today and present them words related to that subject.

But it's not just words. In fact, it's the opposite. The usual language learning apps all make you memorize words after words, in complete isolation of how you would ever use them. We do the opposite. You always see a word being applied in an actual sentence. The idea here is that, by always staying close to the application of words, you will be applying your newfound language skills yourself in no-time.
