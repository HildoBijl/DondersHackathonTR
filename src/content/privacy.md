Let's clarify some things on how we deal with privacy.

- No, we will not sell all your data to the highest bidder. We will consider the second-highest bidder.
- We promise not to break all our promises like Google is known to do. In fact, that's the only promise we promise to break.
- We will send you tons of advertising using exactly those words which you do not know yet. If this frustrates you, feel free to use our app to learn more exotic curses. Trust me: it will help.

Disclaimer for currently enraged people: this policy is ironic. If you didn't notice this, you might be interested in our app to train your sarcasm detection skills: it is scheduled to be developed during the Donders Hackathon 2017.
